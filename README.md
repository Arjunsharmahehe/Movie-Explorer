# ðŸŽ¥ Movie Explorer

Movie Explorer is a dynamic movie exploration platform built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, leveraging the [TMDB (The Movie Database) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). It allows users to browse popular, top-rated, and upcoming movies, view detailed movie information, read reviews, and explore similar movies. You can visit the website by clicking [here](https://movieshehe.netlify.app/)

_The site might not work optimally if a lot of people access it as there is a limit to the API_
